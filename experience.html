<p>In the 21 years I have lived in this world, I have gained a lot of experience from what I have been through before.
But here is a list of the experiences that changed my life the most.
However, there is a lot of story inside every experience.
Many sweet and bitter moments have occurred during my life.

It's an honour to be in this organisation, which is the highest organisation on campus.
In the Students Representative Council (MPP), I bring the voices of the students to the management of UiTM.
This is to ensure that we, as students, can get our privileges.
<p> 
I was in the organisation for 1 year, which is 2 semesters.
As a part of MPP 2021â€“2022, I was in Exco Protocol, Networking, and Sponsorship.
